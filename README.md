## This repo contains information and code examples for MXChip (az3166) board supplied with the Microsoft Azure IoT starter kit. Read more here: aka.ms/iot-devkit

### Redd Plantene / Saving the plants!

Will try to recreate ReddPlantene workshop (http://reddplantene.labben.org) with this chip, but without the soldering part.

1.  Learn about the MXChip.
2.  Connect it
3.  Program it (or maybe its preprogrammed)
4.  Send data to Azure IoT Hub
5.  Visualise with Power BI?
